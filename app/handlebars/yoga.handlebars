            <h4>Yoga is a healing modality.</h4>
            <h5>Mentally. Physically. Emotionally.</h5>
            <p>Personally, it has helped me immensely in overcoming stress,
              injury & anxiety. I enrolled in my first teacher-training because
              deep down I saw how much the practice of yoga healed me. I
              felt compelled to bring that same healing & peace to everyone
              else.</p>

            My private Yoga Session with Emma brought me back to center. It was the
            workout my body needed with the safety my mind needed. She leads class
            with such grace and intention, I felt as strong as I did at peace. I have now
            had Emma come to my home to lead Yoga twice and each time gets better
            than the last. I would highly recommend Emma for a private session. Safety
            and Strength.

            Emma has been teaching yoga to my family and I privately now for a few
            years. Not only is she incredibly good at what she does but she creates a
            safe space for us to practice simply with her energy and words. Emma has
            been my families go to for events, birthday parties, or even when we just
            need to chill after a stressful time. More specifically Emma was extremely
            Covid friendly these last few times we practiced yoga. She respects your
            space, and still has a hands on approach to teaching but FROM A
            DISTANCE.

            Emma has always been a go-to instructor for our lululemon yoga events. She
            is able to adjust her classes in the moment to fit the needs of whoever comes
            to class. Her ability to make class inclusive and challenging for all levels
            makes her a stand-out instructor (and I’ve used a LOT of yoga instructors for
            store events over the last 3 years.) I frequently have class participants reach
            out to thank me for the high quality class whenever Emma has taught. Truly
            the best instructor I’ve had the pleasure to work with!

            Emma led a yoga class with six of my friends for my birthday at my house.
            We practiced in the open air, with our mats 6-feet apart from each other, and
            we all felt very safe. It was a nice work from home distraction, break from the
            news, and overall felt really good to be able to practice yoga again. Her 60
            minute flow was the perfect combination of challenging and feeling good on
            the body. Emma was very specific in her moves, helpful with making sure our
            posture was right, and just made everyone feel safe and calm. At the end of
            the class we all felt stronger, flexible, and minds were more relaxed.

            I was practicing yoga on and off for the last few years. I strongly believe that
            yoga is a practice that connects the mind to the body and I struggled to find
            a teacher that aligned with my values until I took Emma’s class. The way she
            genuinely and intentionally intertwines the two leaves me beyond fulfilled
            every time.
