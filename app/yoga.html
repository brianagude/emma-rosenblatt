          <p>Yoga is a healing modality. Mentally. Physically. Emotionally.
            Personally, it has helped me immensely in overcoming stress,
            injury & anxiety. I enrolled in my first teacher-training because
            deep down I saw how much the practice of yoga healed me. I
            felt compelled to bring that same healing & peace to everyone
            else.</p>

          My private Yoga Session with Emma brought me back to center. It was the
          workout my body needed with the safety my mind needed. She leads class
          with such grace and intention, I felt as strong as I did at peace. I have now
          had Emma come to my home to lead Yoga twice and each time gets better
          than the last. I would highly recommend Emma for a private session. Safety
          and Strength.

          Emma has been teaching yoga to my family and I privately now for a few
          years. Not only is she incredibly good at what she does but she creates a
          safe space for us to practice simply with her energy and words. Emma has
          been my families go to for events, birthday parties, or even when we just
          need to chill after a stressful time. More specifically Emma was extremely
          Covid friendly these last few times we practiced yoga. She respects your
          space, and still has a hands on approach to teaching but FROM A
          DISTANCE.

          Emma has always been a go-to instructor for our lululemon yoga events. She
          is able to adjust her classes in the moment to fit the needs of whoever comes
          to class. Her ability to make class inclusive and challenging for all levels
          makes her a stand-out instructor (and I’ve used a LOT of yoga instructors for
          store events over the last 3 years.) I frequently have class participants reach
          out to thank me for the high quality class whenever Emma has taught. Truly
          the best instructor I’ve had the pleasure to work with!

          Emma led a yoga class with six of my friends for my birthday at my house.
          We practiced in the open air, with our mats 6-feet apart from each other, and
          we all felt very safe. It was a nice work from home distraction, break from the
          news, and overall felt really good to be able to practice yoga again. Her 60
          minute flow was the perfect combination of challenging and feeling good on
          the body. Emma was very specific in her moves, helpful with making sure our
          posture was right, and just made everyone feel safe and calm. At the end of
          the class we all felt stronger, flexible, and minds were more relaxed.

          I was practicing yoga on and off for the last few years. I strongly believe that
          yoga is a practice that connects the mind to the body and I struggled to find
          a teacher that aligned with my values until I took Emma’s class. The way she
          genuinely and intentionally intertwines the two leaves me beyond fulfilled
          every time.
