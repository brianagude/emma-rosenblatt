I would highly recommend Emma for a private session. Safety and Strength.",

Not only is she incredibly good at what she does but she creates a safe space for us to practice simply with her energy and words. Emma has been my families go to for events, birthday parties, or even when we just need to chill after a stressful time. More specifically Emma was extremely Covid friendly these last few times we practiced yoga. She respects your space, and still has a hands on approach to teaching but FROM A DISTANCE.",

Her ability to make class inclusive and challenging for all levels makes her a stand-out instructor (and I’ve used a LOT of yoga instructors for store events over the last 3 years.) I frequently have class participants reach out to thank me for the high quality class whenever Emma has taught. Truly the best instructor I’ve had the pleasure to work with!",

It was a nice work from home distraction, break from the news, and overall felt really good to be able to practice yoga again. Her 60 minute flow was the perfect combination of challenging and feeling good on the body. Emma was very specific in her moves, helpful with making sure our posture was right, and just made everyone feel safe and calm. At the end of the class we all felt stronger, flexible, and minds were more relaxed.",

The way she genuinely and intentionally intertwines the two leaves me beyond fulfilled every time.",
