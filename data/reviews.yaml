reviews:
- review: My private Yoga Session with Emma brought me back to center. It was the
    workout my body needed with the safety my mind needed. She leads class with such
    grace and intention, I felt as strong as I did at peace. I have now had Emma come
    to my home to lead Yoga twice and each time gets better than the last. I would
    highly recommend Emma for a private session. Safety and Strength.

- review: Emma has been teaching yoga to my family and I privately now for a few years.
    Not only is she incredibly good at what she does but she creates a safe space
    for us to practice simply with her energy and words. Emma has been my families
    go to for events, birthday parties, or even when we just need to chill after a
    stressful time. More specifically Emma was extremely Covid friendly these last
    few times we practiced yoga. She respects your space, and still has a hands on
    approach to teaching but FROM A DISTANCE.

- review: Emma has always been a go-to instructor for our lululemon yoga events. She
    is able to adjust her classes in the moment to fit the needs of whoever comes
    to class. Her ability to make class inclusive and challenging for all levels makes
    her a stand-out instructor (and I’ve used a LOT of yoga instructors for store
    events over the last 3 years.) I frequently have class participants reach out
    to thank me for the high quality class whenever Emma has taught. Truly the best
    instructor I’ve had the pleasure to work with!

- review: Emma led a yoga class with six of my friends for my birthday at my house.
    We practiced in the open air, with our mats 6-feet apart from each other, and
    we all felt very safe. It was a nice work from home distraction, break from the
    news, and overall felt really good to be able to practice yoga again. Her 60 minute
    flow was the perfect combination of challenging and feeling good on the body.
    Emma was very specific in her moves, helpful with making sure our posture was
    right, and just made everyone feel safe and calm. At the end of the class we all
    felt stronger, flexible, and minds were more relaxed.

- review: I was practicing yoga on and off for the last few years. I strongly believe
    that yoga is a practice that connects the mind to the body and I struggled to
    find a teacher that aligned with my values until I took Emma’s class. The way
    she genuinely and intentionally intertwines the two leaves me beyond fulfilled
    every time.
